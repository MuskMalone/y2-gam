 // Pick your poison.
 //
 // On GNU/Linux, you have few choices to get the most out of your stack trace.
 //
 // By default you get:
 //	- object filename
 //	- function name
 //
 // In order to add:
 //	- source filename
 //	- line and column numbers
 //	- source code snippet (assuming the file is accessible)

 // Install one of the following libraries then uncomment one of the macro (or
 // better, add the detection of the lib and the macro definition in your build
 // system)

 // - apt-get install libdw-dev ...
 // - g++/clang++ -ldw ...
 // #define BACKWARD_HAS_DW 1

 // - apt-get install binutils-dev ...
 // - g++/clang++ -lbfd ...
 // #define BACKWARD_HAS_BFD 1

 // - apt-get install libdwarf-dev ...
 // - g++/clang++ -ldwarf ...
 // #define BACKWARD_HAS_DWARF 1

 // Regardless of the library you choose to read the debug information,
 // for potentially more detailed stack traces you can use libunwind
 // - apt-get install libunwind-dev
 // - g++/clang++ -lunwind
 // #define BACKWARD_HAS_LIBUNWIND 1
